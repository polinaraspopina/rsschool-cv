                        <p>A decision to pursue a career in IT was easy to me, as I graduated a lyceum specializing mainly in mathematics and informatics. This is why I am currently getting a BCs degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering.</p>
                        <p>About a year ago I got really intrested in Web Developing. It is fascinating to me how much you can do with a seemingly small set of tools, but more importantly, how much you can learn and grow thanks to all the open-source resources in this field.</p>
                        <p>I believe that my curiousity for knowledge and strong personality will allow me to become an adaptable and rsponsible Front-end Developer.</p>
